>>>> TODOS:

must haves:
– add chat messages timestamps
- style the chat window scrollbar
- limit chat message length + show chars indicator in the input (ex. 0/100)
– fix a bug, when sometimes it's impossible to login/register (try catch maybe after some interval?)
- add navbar
- MOVE BOX STYLING INTO GLOBAL STYLESHEET & FIX CHATROOM.VUE MOBILE VIEW


nice to haves:
- add skeleton loader
– add 'Currently Online' section (show which users are online atm)
- add page loader (on refresh and first page enter)
- add :focus state for buttons
- add loading button in chatroom when sending new message

difficult:
- add functionality with private rooms (users can enter specific chatroom by typing the secret code)
– use username & password login instead of email & password
– log in automatically after registering an account
