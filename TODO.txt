– fix a bug, when sometimes it's impossible to login/register (try catch maybe after some interval?)
- add navbar
- MOVE BOX STYLING INTO GLOBAL STYLESHEET & FIX CHATROOM.VUE MOBILE VIEW
– code refactoring and cleanup


nice to haves:
- add skeleton loader
– add 'Currently Online' section (show which users are online atm)
- add page loader (on refresh and first page enter)
- add :focus state for buttons
- add loading button in chatroom when sending new message
– better error handling authentication

difficult:
