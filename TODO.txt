- add navbar
- MOVE BOX STYLING INTO GLOBAL STYLESHEET & FIX CHATROOM.VUE MOBILE VIEW
– code refactoring and cleanup
– fix infinite loading overlay covering scrollbar on chat window


nice to haves:
- add skeleton loader
– add 'Currently Online' section (show which users are online atm)
– better error handling authentication

difficult:
